*Description*  
 - In this project, we need to use the repository [cloud-nebulous-serverless](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/cloud-nebulous-serverless) and implement 3 fractals from the website - https://tashfeen.org where we need to take 2 different resolutions low and high from the fractals and display it in a public HTML page using *Cloud Function* and *Cloud Run*.
